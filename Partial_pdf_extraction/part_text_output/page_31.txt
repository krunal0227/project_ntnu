The Way We Do Business

At Accenture, our people care deeply about doing the right thing. Together, we have proven that we can succeed—providing 
value to our clients and shareholders and opportunities for our people—while being a powerful force for good. Our shared 
commitment to operating with the highest ethical standard and making a positive difference in everything we do is what we 
believe differentiates Accenture. We believe in transparency, that transparency builds trust, and that we must earn the trust of 
our clients, our people, our partners and our communities each and every day.

Our Code of Business Ethics is organized into six fundamental behaviors: Make Your Conduct Count; Comply with Laws; 
Deliver for Our Clients; Protect People, Information and Our Business; Run Our Business Responsibly; and Be a Good 
Corporate Citizen. It applies to all our people—regardless of their title or location. With our Code of Business Ethics, we want 
to help our people make ethical behavior a natural part of what we do every day—with each other, our clients, our partners 
and our communities.

Accenture’s commitment to and focus on our people and culture has generated significant recognition, including No. 1 on the 
FTSE (formerly Refinitiv) Diversity and Inclusion Index for the fifth time in seven years; Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical 
Companies for 17 consecutive years; and ranking No. 10 among 25 companies on Great Place To Work® World's Best 
Workplaces™. 

Our Health, Safety and Well-Being

We are committed to creating a place where people can be successful both professionally and personally. We take a holistic 
view of well-being—including physical, mental, emotional and financial well-being—providing specially defined programs and 
practices to meet our people’s fundamental human needs.
