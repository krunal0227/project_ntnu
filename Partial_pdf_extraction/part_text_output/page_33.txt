Moving Toward Zero Waste

•

•

Addressing e-waste and office furniture. We have a goal of reusing or recycling 100% of our e-waste, such as 
computers and servers, as well as all our office furniture, by the end of 2025. During fiscal 2024, we reused or recycled 
nearly 100% of our e-waste relating to computers, servers and uninterruptible power supply devices. We continue to 
refine our processes, leverage our asset tracking system and work with vendors to help us extend the life cycle of our 
furniture, including through refurbishment and reuse or recycling.

Eliminate single-use plastics in our office locations. During fiscal 2024, we continued to meet our goal of eliminating 
single-use plastics in our office locations by purchasing reusable and plastic-free items. 

Planning for Water Risk

• Mitigating the potential impacts of climate change-related water risk. Although Accenture is not a water-intensive 

company, to safeguard our people and operations we are developing water resiliency action plans to reduce the impact of 
climate-related flooding, drought and water scarcity on our business and our people in high-risk areas. We have 
completed plans for approximately 90% of our facilities in high-risk areas.
