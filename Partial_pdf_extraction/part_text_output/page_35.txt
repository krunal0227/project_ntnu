Competition

Accenture operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace. We compete with a variety of 
organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer—but we believe no other company offers the 
full range of services at scale that Accenture does, which uniquely positions us in a highly competitive market. Our clients 
typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis. 

Our competitors include large multinational IT service providers, including the services arms of large global technology 
providers; off-shore IT service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India; accounting firms and consultancies that 
provide consulting, managed services and other IT services and solutions; solution or service providers that compete with us 
in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, including advertising agency holding companies, engineering 
services providers and technology start-ups; and in-house IT departments of large corporations that use their own resources 
rather than engage an outside firm, such as global capability centers ( “GCC’s”). 

We believe Accenture competes successfully in the marketplace because: 

• We are focused on creating 360° value, which we 
define as delivering the financial business case and 
unique value a client may be seeking, and striving to 
partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on 
inclusion and diversity, reskill and upskill our clients’ 
employees, help our clients achieve their sustainability 
goals, and create meaningful experiences, both with 
Accenture and for the customers and employees of our 
clients;

• We are a trusted partner with long-term client 

relationships and a proven track record for delivering 
from strategy to execution, on large, complex programs 
at speed that drive outcomes and tangible value;  

• We provide a broad range of services bringing 

together our capabilities at scale and have a significant 
presence in every major geographic market, enabling us 
to leverage our global expertise in a local context to 
deliver the best solutions, and our managed services 
help companies move faster by leveraging our digital 
platform and talent and reduce costs;

•

The breadth and scale of our technology 
capabilities, combined with our strong relationships 
with our technology ecosystem partners, enable us to 
help clients transform and re-platform in a sustainable 
way at speed;

•

• We have deep industry and cross-industry 

expertise, which enable us to accelerate value as 
clients transform their products, customer experiences 
and optimize their operations;

• We continuously invest in advanced tools, methods 
and platforms, and the highly specialized skills of 
our people, to create repeatable industry and cross 
industry solutions and assets, that can scale at speed, 
leveraging our deep experience, knowledge and insights 
across industries, functions and services, often with our 
ecosystem partners;

•

Our industry-leading innovation approach—including 
Accenture Research, Accenture Ventures and Accenture 
Labs as well as our Studios, Innovation Centers and 
Delivery Centers—reflects our commitment to 
continuous innovation and enables us to rapidly identify, 
incubate, and scale emerging technology solutions for 
our clients;

• We have deep experience in AI, having embedded AI 

across our worldwide service delivery approach for more 
than a decade, and are making significant investments 
in solutions at scale to help our clients responsibly 
advance and use AI, and generative AI, to develop new 
strategies, operating models, business cases and digital 
core architecture, enabling them to achieve greater 
growth, efficiency, and resiliency, while accelerating 
value; and

Our goal is to recruit the most talented people in our 
markets, and we have an unwavering commitment to 
inclusion and diversity, which creates an environment 
that unleashes innovation, and a world-class learning 
organization that helps us continuously invest in the 
development of our people, and we believe our strategy 
to deliver 360° value makes us an attractive destination 
for top talent, a trusted partner to our clients and 
ecosystem, and a respected member of our 
communities.
